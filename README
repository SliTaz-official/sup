SliTaz Users Packages
================================================================================

CURRENT : cook extract and install work nicely.

The goal is to have a user land packages management system using SHell scripts
to pack and install files. The sup packages can install all kind of files such
as scripts, non free tools, icons, wallpapers, templates, pre-compiled binary,
etc. Sup is designed to handle software that can/should be installed in user
space such as web frameworks.

This let user get involve in the project without coding skills, sup provide a
cmdline tool and a GTK+ interface to install and build packages. The server
provide a CGI web interface to upload packages receipt and files. The build 
is a simple pack without compilations since the idea is to provide custom 
tools using scripting languages or precompiled packages such as Firefox.

Sup will be also usefull in live mode with a persistent home mounted so users
will have installed sup packages without having a too big rootfs in RAM.

Quickstart
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1) Get source:
     $ hg clone http://hg.slitaz.org/sup
  2) Change dir and become root:
     $ cd sup && su
  3) Install clients as root:
     $ make && make install-clients
  4) Play :-)
     $ sup help
  

Where goes what ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * sup         Client side cmdline tool to install and cook packages
                --> /usr/bin/sup
  * sup-box     GTK+ Client side user iinterface to manage packages
                --> /usr/bin/sup-box
  * libsup.sh   Shared SHell function between sup tools
                --> /usr/lib/slitaz/libsup.sh
  * server      Server side web interface: TinyCM/SCN plugin
                --> http://scn.slitaz.org/?sup


Development environment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's easy to work on sup code, commands will talk by them self:

  --> Cmdline client
  $ hg clone http://hg.slitaz.org/sup
  $ cd sup && ./sup
  
  --> Server side needs lighttpd & TinyCM install
  $ make DESTDIR=/home/tux/Public/cgi-bin/tinycm server-install
  $ tazweb http://localhost/~tux/cgi-bin/tinycm/?sup


Developers coding style
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keep sup simple, clean and fast. Sup tools are written in SHell script, ther
use libtaz.sh and httphelper.sh functions. Sup use XDG directories paths to 
store packages information and build process:
	
  ~/.local         User data, executables and sup database
  ~/.cache         Non-essiential data such as tmp and build files
  ~/.config        Peer user configuration files


Packages format and max size
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sup packages are cpio archive compressed with lzma and with a .sup extension.
The goal is to have lightweight packages with every big file downloaded from
the web.

Sup use a minimal 'receipt' with an sup_install() function to dl any wanted 
files, no pkg size or file list are created when packing. A list of installed
files is generated at install.

Package can have a single receipt or a local/ folder with files to install. All
download and extracting must be done in the cache to build-up a list of files
before installing. The package folder tree should look like that:

  * receipt                    Sup package receipt
  * README                     Optional sup package desc/howto
  * files                      For all installed files
  
files/
  |- local/bin                 For executable binaries and scripts
  |- local/share/XXX           Where XXX is the name of the package
  |- local/share/applications  All .desktop files for menu entry
   ` config/                   For any configuration file in ~/.config

More directories into files/ can be added accourding to the needs and goal 
of the packages

Receipt variables and function
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Her is the variables used or usable in sup receipt as well as the uniq function.
Checkout the sup-demo package for a receipt example.

  * $build_date     Auto added by 'sup cook' to get the build date
  * $sup_size       Auto added by 'sup cook' to get installed size


Packages dependencies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since sup is not run as root, less deps is better but some precompiled packages
will need some system wide tools/libraries, sup will not install any system wide
package but warn is dependencies are not installed if DEPENDS is set. 

Sup packages can be very simple but also very complex, so feel free to use the 
receipt to warn or promt users to make an action.


Cook sup packages to be uploaded to server
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sup let users upload package to server. To cook your first one you may want to
the sup-demo package:

  $ sup cook --init
  $ cp -rf /usr/share/sup/wok/sup-demo ~/.local/share/sup/wok
  $ sup cook sup-demo


Mime type & Icon
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The *.sup file are reconised by the system as sup packages using an mime type
XML file installed in /usr/share/mime/packages/sup.xml. When data/mime/sup.xml
is newly installed you can update the mime database:

  $ update-mime-database /usr/share/mime/

Sup use a generic icon: application-x-archive


Translations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To start a new translation please use msginit from the pot file directory.
Example for French/France locale (fr_FR):

	$ msginit -l fr_FR -o fr.po -i tazbox.pot

To update all pot files when some new strings have been added (mainly for
developers before commit):

	$ make pot

To update all translations from the pot file:

	$ make msgmerge

To compile po files for testing purposes you can use 'make msgfmt' or manually
compile your translation. Example for french locale, note that the file must
be copied into /usr/share/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES so gettext can find it:

	$ msgfmt -o sup-client.mo fr.po
